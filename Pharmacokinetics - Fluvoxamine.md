Effects on CYP450 isoenzymes

Metabolism/Transport Effects

**Substrate** of CYP1A2 (minor), CYP2D6 (minor); **Note:** Assignment of Major/Minor substrate status based on clinically relevant drug interaction potential; **Inhibits** CYP1A2 (strong), CYP2C19 (moderate), CYP2C9 (weak), CYP2D6 (weak), CYP3A4 (weak)

 it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are known to be involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as: CYP1A2 (e.g., warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, tizanidine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam), and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole).

Metabolism by CYP450 isoenzymes

In vitro data suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6
