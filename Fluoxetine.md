# The Psychopharmacology of Fluoxetine: Mechanism of Action, Indications, Pharmacokinetics and Dosing

## In a nutshell


## Pharmacodynamics

* Animal studies reveal that:
	* Fluoxetine inhibits the serotonin transporter protein (SERT). 
		* Potent serotonin uptake inhibitor
	* At higher concentrations, fluoxetine inhibits 5HT2C receptors. [^Pälvimäki]
		* This may mediate increased synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.	[^Bymaster]
* Potential clinical implications:
	* The 5HT2C antagonism is thought to contribute to fluoxetine's activating properties.

## Pharmacokinetics
### Half-life

* Fluoxetine half-life: 2-4 days
	* Norfluoxetine (active metabolite) half-life: 7-14 days 
* Benefits of a long half-life:
	* Patients are less likely to experience serotonin discontinuation symptoms after a missed dose or when discontinuing treatment. [^Carlat]
* Prescribing considerations related to long-half life:
	* The effects of dose changes will not be fully reflected for several weeks.
	* If you need to switch a patient from fluoxetine to an MAOI, you must wait a longer washout period before initiating the MAOI. It is generally recommended to wait 5 weeks.[^Prozac]
	*  Weekly delayed-release fluoxetine 90mg yields similar plasma levels to 10-20mg daily. [^Procyshyn]
### Effects on CYP2D6


![fluoxetine_cyp2d6](https://cdn.psychopharmacologyinstitute.com/%5BGuides%5D/Fluoxetine%20-%20Strong%20CYP2D6%20inhibitor.svg)
* Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6. 
	* This may cause individuals with regular CYP2D6 metabolic activity to resemble poor metabolizers.
	* Fluoxetine can increase the levels of pimozide and thioridazine.

 
## Indications

### FDA-approved indications and dosing

#### Overview
* Mood disorders:
	* Major depressive disorder
	* Bipolar depression (as olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, Symbyax)
	* Treatment-resistant depression(as olanzapine/fluoxetine combination, Symbyax)
* Anxiety disorders: 
	* Panic disorder
	* OCD
* Fluoxetine is the only antidepressant approved for the treatment of bulimia.
#### Major depressive disorder
* Adults
	* Starting dose: 
		* Initiate 20 mg/day orally in the morning. 
	* Dose increases:
		* Consider a dose increase after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. 
			* Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon).
		* Maximum dose: 80 mg/day.
* Pediatric (children and adolescents):
	*  Fluoxetine is the recommended first-line medication for depression in children and adolescents. [^NICE-Depression-children-adolescents]
	* Initiate 10 or 20 mg/day. 
	* After 1 week at 10 mg/day, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. 
		* However, due to higher plasma levels in lower-weight children, the starting and target dose in this group may be 10 mg/day. 
		* Consider a dose increase to 20 mg/day after several weeks if insufficient clinical improvement is observed. 
#### Obsessive-compulsive disorder
* Adults
	* Starting dose:
		* Initiate 20 mg/day orally in the morning. 
	* Dose increases:
		* It may take at least 5 weeks of treatment for the complete therapeutic effect to be achieved.
		* If there is not enough clinical improvement after several weeks, consider a dose increase. 
		* Administer doses above 20 mg/day once daily in the morning or twice daily (i.e., morning and noon). 
	* Dose range:
		* A dose range of 20 to 60 mg/day is recommended.
	  * Maximum dose:
		  * The maximum dose should not exceed 80 mg/day.
  * Pediatric (children and adolescents)
	  * In adolescents and higher-weight children:
		  * Initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day.
		  * After 2 weeks, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. 
		  * Dose range: 20 to 60 mg/day.
	  * In lower-weight children:
		* Initiate treatment with a dose of 10 mg/day.
		* Dose range: 20 to 30 mg/day. 
#### Panic disorder
* Starting dose:
	* Initiate 10 mg/day. 
* Dose increases:
	* After one week, increase the dose to 20 mg/day. 
* Dose range: 10 to 60 mg/day.
* Maximum dose: 60 mg/day
	* The most frequently administered dose in the 2 flexible-dose clinical trials was 20 mg/day.
#### Bulimia nervosa

* Early response (at 3 weeks) is a strong predictor of response overall.[^Sysko] 
* Starting dose:
	* 60 mg/day in the morning.
	* For some patients, it may be advisable to titrate up to this target dose over several days. 
* Dose range:
	* 60 mg/day
* Maximum dose:
	* Fluoxetine doses above 60 mg/day have not been systematically studied in patients with bulimia. 

#### Bipolar depression (as Symbyax)

* The olanzapine/fluoxetine combination is recommended by NICE guidelines, along with quetiapine, as the first-line treatment for bipolar depression in youth as in adults. [^NICE-Depression-children-adolescents]
	* The well-known adverse effect profile of olanzapine constrains its use.
* In markets where Symbyax is not available, combining olanzapine and fluoxetine (e.g. 5/20mg or 10/40mg) can achieve the same effects. [^Maudsley]
* Adults
	* Timing: Once daily in the evening.
	* Starting dose:
		* Start with the olanzapine 6 mg/ fluoxetine 25 mg capsule.
	* Maximum dose: olanzapine 12 mg/ fluoxetine 50 mg once daily.
* Children and adolescents (10 -17 years of age)
	* Timing: Once daily in the evening.
	* Starting dose: 
		* Olanzapine 3 mg/ fluoxetine 25 mg 
	* Maximum dose: 
		* Olanzapine 12 mg/ fluoxetine 50 mg
  
#### Treatment-resistant depression (as Symbyax)
* Adults
	* Timing: Once daily in the evening.
	* Starting dose: 
		* Start with the olanzapine 6 mg/ fluoxetine 25 mg capsule.
	* Maximum dose: olanzapine 12 mg/ fluoxetine 50 mg once daily.
### Off-label uses

#### Repetitive behaviors in ASD

* Normally, much lower doses of fluoxetine are required to treat repetitive behaviors in ASD patients than those used to treat depression. [^Maudsley]
* Use a liquid preparation and begin at the lowest possible dose, monitoring for adverse effects. 
* Dosing: 
	* 2.5mg/day a day for 1 week
		*  2.5mg = 0.625mL, which is difficult to measure accurately.
	* Follow with a flexible titration schedule of 0.8mg/kg/day.
		* Week 2: 0.3mg/kg 
		* Week 3: 0.5mg/kg/day
		* 0.8mg/kg/ day subsequently
#### PTSD 

* The overall evidence is inconclusive regarding the efficacy of fluoxetine for PTSD, especially in veterans. The results from placebo-controlled trials are mixed.  [^Bajor]
#### Social anxiety disorder

* All SSRIs are probably effective for social anxiety disorder, but some have stronger supporting evidence. [^Osser-SAD] 
* Fluoxetine may have some efficacy in treating SAD, but the results appear less robust than those of other SSRIs. [^Blanco]

## Adverse effects
### Most common side effects

* Nausea, diarrhea
* Activation symptoms
	* Nervousness
	* Insomnia
* Sleep symptoms:
	* Insomnia
	* Abnormal dreams
* Anorexia
	* Monitor for significant weight loss, especially if the patient is underweight or has a bulimia nervosa diagnosis.
* Antidepressant-induced excessive sweating (ADIES): [^Thompson] [^Mago]
	*  Dose-related side effect
	- If antidepressant dose reduction is clinically feasible, it should be tried.
	- Switching to another antidepressant might be effective.
	- Adding another medication (an "antidote"):
		-  When antidepressant dose reduction or switching is not an option.
		-  Evidence of fair quality supports the use of terazosin (an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker).
* Tremor
* Sexual dysfunction: [^Goldberg]
	* Decreased libido: up to 4% incidence
	* There are no specific incidence reports for impotence, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, or anorgasmia.
	* "Drug holidays" are not effective for fluoxetine. [^Rothschild]
* Headache
* Rash

### Serious, but rare side effects

* Hyponatremia, mainly in the elderly.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, especially when combined with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen.

## Use in special populations
### Breastfeeding

* The average amount of drug in breastmilk is higher with fluoxetine than with most other SSRIs
* Agents that are less excreted in breast milk may be a better option, especially when nursing a newborn or preterm infant. [^Lactmed]
* Should breastfeeding be stopped?
	* If fluoxetine is required by the mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. 
* Should fluoxetine be switched during breastfeeding?
	* If a mother was taking fluoxetine during pregnancy or if other antidepressants proved ineffective, most experts advise against switching medications while breastfeeding.

### Hepatic impairment

* Liver impairment can increase the half-lives of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. [^Prozac]
	*  It can take many weeks to reach steady-state serum levels.
	*  Fluoxetine is complex to use in this population. 
* If fluoxetine is administered to patients with liver disease: [^Maudsley]
	* consider a dose reduction of at least 50%, or
	* consider alternate-day dosing.
### Renal impairment

* GFR 20–50mL/min: dose as normal renal function.
* GFR <20mL/min: 
	* use a low dose or, 
	* use alternate day dosing, and increase according to response
